# VRASP
**Vehicle Routing and Appointment Scheduling Problem(VRASP)** with stochastic traveling and service time. 
Use **Sample Average Approxiamation(SAA)** to transform the stochastic problem into a deterministic one.
Contain both **CPLEX 12.9** and **Variable Neighorhood Search(VNS)** impementation.
# Dependencies
```
Anaconda Python 3.7
cplex 12.10
docplex 2.11
numpy 1.21.6
